# Active Context & Session State

## 1. Current Context
- **Main Focus**: Memory Bank structure established with command-based workflow.
- **Status**: Setup complete. Ready for development.

## 2. Recent Changes
| Date | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2026-01-06 | Infra | Created `mb-commands.mdc` with standardized AI commands for self-directed development. |
| 2026-01-06 | Infra | Created Memory Bank files: `mb-product-context.mdc`, `mb-system-patterns.mdc`, `mb-tech-stack.mdc`. |
| 2026-01-06 | Infra | Created `mb-active-context.mdc` file. |

## 3. Next Steps (Checklist)
- [x] Create `mb-product-context.mdc` (Business Context).
- [x] Create `mb-system-patterns.mdc` (Technical Patterns).
- [x] Create `mb-tech-stack.mdc` (Technology Definitions).
- [x] Create `mb-commands.mdc` (Standardized AI Commands).
- [ ] Begin NestJS project implementation (Phase 1: Setup with Fastify).

## 4. Active Architecture Decisions
- **Memory Bank**: Migrated from root `/memory` folder to native `.cursor/rules` system.
- **Format**: `.mdc` files with frontmatter for context routing.
- **Development Approach**: Command-based workflow (not templates) to maintain hands-on learning and control.
- **AI Role**: Assistant/guide rather than code generator. User writes code, AI provides analysis and guidance.

## 5. Open Questions / Blockers
- None at the moment.
