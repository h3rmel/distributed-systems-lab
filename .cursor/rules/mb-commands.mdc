# Memory Bank Commands

Standardized commands for consistent AI assistant behavior. These commands define clear expectations for specific actions.

**Commands are now organized in individual files:**
- Each command has its own file in `.cursor/commands/`
- File naming: `<command-name>.mdc` (e.g., `summarize.mdc`, `commit.mdc`)
- Each file contains the full command documentation

**To view all commands:**
- Use `/list-commands` to see all available commands
- Or browse `.cursor/commands/` directory

## Command Categories

### Session Management
- `/summarize` - Start a new coding session with full context refresh
- `/list-commands` - Return the list of available Memory Bank commands
- `/update-context` - Update Memory Bank context files after significant work

- `/document [file/function]` - Help create or improve documentation

### Testing
- `/test-guide [feature/function]` - Provide guidance on testing strategy

### Architecture
- `/architecture [module/system]` - Explain or analyze architectural decisions
- `/dependencies [module/file]` - Analyze and visualize dependencies

### Performance

### Search
- `/find [pattern/concept]` - Search codebase for specific patterns

### Git
- `/changes` - Summarize recent changes and their impact
- `/commit [options]` - Commit changes using semantic (Conventional Commits) messages

## Command Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Commands

**Use commands when you want:**
- Structured, predictable AI behavior
- To learn and understand (not just get solutions)
- To maintain control over implementation
- To follow established patterns consistently

### Command Composition

Commands can be combined:
```
User: /summarize then /investigate WebhookModule
AI: [Executes both in sequence]
```

### Custom Parameters

Add specifics to commands:
```
User: /review src/webhook/ --focus=error-handling
AI: [Reviews webhook module focusing on error handling]
```

## AI Behavior Guidelines

### Core Principles

1. **Teach, Don't Do:** Explain and guide rather than implementing (unless explicitly asked)
2. **Context-Aware:** Always reference Memory Bank files for standards
3. **Ask, Don't Assume:** When unclear, ask for clarification
4. **Concise but Complete:** Be thorough but respect user's time
5. **Code Second:** Only generate code when user explicitly requests it

### Response Format

All command responses should:
- Start with clear section headers
- Use bullet points for lists
- Include code examples from actual project (not generic)
- Reference Memory Bank files when relevant
- End with a clarifying question or next step

### What NOT to Do

- ❌ Don't generate full implementations unprompted
- ❌ Don't update files without explicit permission
- ❌ Don't add dependencies without approval
- ❌ Don't commit changes without explicit instruction
- ❌ Don't assume requirements - ask questions
