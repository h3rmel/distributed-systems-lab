# `/plan [task]`

**Purpose:** Help plan implementation approach without generating code.

**AI Actions:**
1. Understand the task
2. Investigate relevant existing code
3. Create implementation plan:
   - **Phase 1:** Preparation (what to read, what to understand)
   - **Phase 2:** Core implementation (what files to modify)
   - **Phase 3:** Integration (how to connect pieces)
   - **Phase 4:** Testing (what to test)
4. Identify risks and challenges
5. Reference relevant Memory Bank patterns
6. Ask: "Does this plan make sense? What would you like to tackle first?"

**Example:**
```
User: /plan add webhook retry mechanism
AI: [Provides step-by-step implementation plan without code]
```
