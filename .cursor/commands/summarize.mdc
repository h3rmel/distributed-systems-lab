# `/summarize`

**Purpose:** Start a new coding session with full context refresh.

**AI Actions:**
1. Read all Memory Bank files in `.cursor/rules/`:
   - `mb-active-context.mdc` (current state)
   - `mb-product-context.mdc` (business goals)
   - `mb-system-patterns.mdc` (technical patterns)
   - `mb-tech-stack.mdc` (technology stack)
2. Provide a concise summary:
   - Current project phase/focus
   - Recent changes from active context
   - Next steps checklist status
   - Open questions or blockers
3. Ask: "What would you like to work on?"

**Example:**
```
User: /summarize
AI: [Reads all mb-*.mdc files, provides summary]
```
